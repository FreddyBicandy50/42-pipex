## Status
Started: 18/08/2024.

Finished: 31/08/2024.

Grade: 100%.

## Project Idea
This project aims to deepen your understanding of the two concepts that you already know: Redirections and Pipes. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.

## Usage
``make`` to compile mandatory part.

``./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile``


``make bonus`` to compile mandatory part.

`` ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 ... cmdn file2``

## Guides

The most interesting part of any project is the research that goes behind it. If you are a student, please don't miss out on that opportunity by simply following guides such as these. In any case, they should under no circumstances be your only source of information about this project. Try things, fail, research, try again and succeed! And maybe write your own guide about it. Writing really is the best way to learn.
